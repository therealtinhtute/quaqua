# PreToolUse gate (rules/_all/fanout-agent-grid.md + AGENTS.md rule 3). Binary
# resolution: $QUAQUA_BIN, else `quaqua` on PATH; the binary owns the real
# tokenizer + policy (`quaqua gate`).
#
# The fence must not vanish when the binary is missing: Claude Code treats every
# exit code other than 2 as a non-blocking error, so a bare `quaqua gate` that
# dies 127 would let every pane/workspace spawn+move through (review r1 finding,
# runs/suhuynh-r6r1.md). It must also not lock an agent out of the shell before
# it can build the binary, so the fallback blocks only the guarded commands and
# lets everything else through with a warning.
#
# The fallback is deliberately cheap (no tokenizer): it scans the raw hook JSON
# on stdin for `herdr … <guarded pair>` and for outward actions (`git … push`,
# the enumerated `gh` write subcommands). That is a conservative superset — it
# also blocks argument text such as `echo "herdr pane split"` — which errs
# toward blocking while the binary is unavailable. The binary is the precise
# path (its `git push` reads the hook cwd to resolve a refspec-less push; here
# every push is blocked, which is the fail-closed side of `ask`).
# `h\e\rdr`-style escaping is the one known miss; install the binary for exact
# semantics.
